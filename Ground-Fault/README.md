## Introduction

Ground Swell is a clone of Fuzzhugger FX's [Arc Flash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBF0-cEVhbo) pedal that is, sadly, out of production. The [trace](https://forum.pedalpcb.com/threads/fuzzhugger-arc-flash.10081/post-361108) is from the user Almondcity on the PedalPCB forums. The only large changes I've made to the trace is more filtering on the DC input, otherwise it is exactly as presented in the trace.
